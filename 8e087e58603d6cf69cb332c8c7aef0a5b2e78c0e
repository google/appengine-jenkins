Give the nested Docker images a fixed tag (based on timestamp) that is never re-used, so that we can ensure that a tagged version of the master image will use a compatible version of the nested images.\n2. Remove the use of the build script for deploying a stable image, as #1 now allows us to promote an existing \"testing\" image to \"latest\" instead of building the \"latest\" image directly from source.","baseCommit":"046ab42677f817a7d424c6a095fb87fe3c0cd6db"}
